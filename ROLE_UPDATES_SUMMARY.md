## Testing the Changes

### Test AI Agent Access

```bash
# Test AI agent can view journals
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <ai-agent-token>" \
     http://localhost:3000/journal/

# Test AI agent can view Chart of Accounts (read-only)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <ai-agent-token>" \
     http://localhost:3000/admin/coa/readonly
```

### Test Member Access

```bash
# Test member can view journals
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <member-token>" \
     http://localhost:3000/journal/

# Test member can make online payment
curl -X POST \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <member-token>" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"amount": 100, "description": "Membership fee"}' \
     http://localhost:3000/journal/online-payment
```

## Security Considerations

1. **AI Agent Role**: Limited to read-only operations only
2. **Member Role**: Can make payments but cannot access sensitive admin functions
3. **Role Hierarchy**: Maintains proper privilege levels
4. **Token Validation**: All roles still require valid JWT tokens
5. **Tenant Isolation**: All operations remain tenant-scoped

## Migration Notes

- Existing tokens with AI or MEMBER roles will automatically work with new permissions
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- New routes are additive and don't affect existing routes
- Role hierarchy remains backward compatible
